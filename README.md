# Round-2 (LYNQ)

### Used Google's Gemini API 

## 1. Level-1
### llm_call.py : 
#### Run the file to talk with Gemini, with a simple CLI Chatbot. 

### pdf_reader.py : 
#### Simple PDF text extractor and analyzer using pypdf and Gemini. Test the user-defined functions by modifying the code. The file acts like a simple backend for the Frontend UI 

### ui_interface.py: A simple interface to upload PDF files and perform pre-defined actions on them
#### How to run? In the level1 directory, type in the following command to run a localhost
"streamlit run ui_interface.py"
#### It should open a localhost live session that can be accessed from a default browser by ctrl clicking the address mentioned in terminal. Test the features available.
#### I've used the Streamlit library, which is a free, simple python library that help create a working frontend within seconds.
